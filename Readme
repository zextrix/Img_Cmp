Instructions to run the project:

Firstly, download the index.bmp image as given in the folder on D:\ drive or make necessary changes in the code to detect the image.
Also, the image dimensions are hard-coded in the main class, so please use the image given only.

1. Run the java project and only enter 1( or else the code will crash as it won't find a file which is created later on).
2. Run the .cpp file
3. Go back to the java project and then enter 2 while the code is running.

The general idea is that:
-> An image is taken, here specifically named index.bmp .
-> The image's pixel values are taken in java, stored onto a .txt file.
-> The .cpp file shifts the pixel values.
-> The shifted pixel values are used to create a new image in java.
