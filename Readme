Instructions to run the project:

1. First run the java project and only enter 1( or else the code will crash as it won't find a file which is created later on).
2. Run the .cpp file
3. Go back to the java project and then enter 2 while the code is running.

The general idea is that:
-> An image is taken, here specifically named index.bmp .
-> The image's pixel values are taken in java, stored onto a .txt file.
-> The .cpp file shifts the pixel values.
-> The shifted pixel values are used to create a new image in java.
